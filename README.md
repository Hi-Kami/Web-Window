# Web-Window
Window creator for browsers, using jQuery. Whiles it mostly works I was trying to create a window system that functioned like windows on windows however I was unable to get them to delete them selves. I conclueded I would have to rewrite the system to include a window manager so it could have fuctonality to delete its self.

# What I learned
* Increased my ability to use jQuery
* More control on a web page

# How I could improve
* Main thing is to replace the system with a managed window verson
* Interface was basic, could style it to be better looking
